# MealPlan
1)Android - Create a meal plan
2) First I Think of using Kotlin, because it is an expressive language that reduces common code errors and easily integrates into existing apps because but Google's libraries, tooling, documentation, and learning resources continue to embrace a Kotlin-first approach making it the better language for Android today. and after that I think of a model structure in a sheet where i linked all the requirements and then I choose the MVVM pattern and then think of rest of the functionalities and write a code in a generic way e,g if you want to add a meal for more than 3 times you can do that with a 1 minute change.
3) It is a healthy activity and the assignment enable my skills to see the purpose of your coding and some definite objectives to be achieved, and happy to take these kind of challenges.
4) Such as nothing but at first i go with activities for a dayList and menuList and then activities are not suppored sharedViewModel so I changed it to the Fragments.
5) Yes I followed all the principles that we need for writing the clean code.
